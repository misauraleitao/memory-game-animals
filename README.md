# Memory Game Animals

[View the live project here.]()

## About

Milestone Project Two / Interactive Frontend Development / Code Institute

This is a single user simple game where the user has to find all matches to win. It counts the score through the number of matches the user manages and counts every move everytime the user flips a card.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

This is a fun game aimed for all ages to mainly pass their time. Even though it is a simple game it allows you to train your brain and the more you do it the quicker you get better with matching every card.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   For colour scheme I used a lightskyblue and used a very subtle gradient image on the card-back. As for the text headings I decided to go with mustard yellow as it constrasts nicely with blue and white for the second heading to catch user's attention to detail.

        #### Typography
        -  I used a standard bootstrap paragraph font and as for the headings I used google fonts in - 'Otomanopee One'.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The images that are used are all cartoon images of animals and they all are clip arts with a checked grey and white background. This makes it light on the eyes and goes perfect with the rest of the color scheme. The cartoon images are also got a cute look perfect for children and easier to remember when playing the game.
    ### Wireframes
    -  Here you can see pictures of the wireframes drawn.

## Testing

- [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - used to validate HTML
    - no warnings or errors.
- [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - used to vaildate CSS Code
    - no warnings or errors.

 I used [DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) to ensure the responsiveness of the site as well as looking/fixing any bugs within the code.
 * I tested the following types:

    * iPad Pro (portrait: 1024x1366 & landscape: 1366x1024)
    * iPad (portrait: 768x1024 & landscape: 1024x768)

    * Pixel 2 (portrait: 411x731 & landscape: 731x411
   - There are no responsiveness issues with the site and the game looks well on all devices (desktop,laptop,tablet and phone). I also used [Am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to ensure responsiveness on all devices.

   I also tested it on diferent desktops
 * I tested the following types:

    * LeNovo
    * HP
    * Dell

Testing game functionality-
  - Tested the layout of the website.
  - Tested that all tiles flip around with no issues when clicked.
  - Tested that the tiles will flip back around with no issues if the pair does not match.
  - Tested that the tiles will will stay face up if there is a match found. 
  - Tested that the player can only click two cards at a time, and the cards need to flip around if a match is not found for a third card to be clicked.
  - Tested that the clicks counter counts the moves correctly.
  - Tested that once the game is won a pop up message appears.


  I also tested the site on the following browsers-
  - Chrome - no issues
  - Firefox - no issues
  - IE EDGE -no issues
  - Opera -no issues
  - Safari - no issues

    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
